# Antlia - A movie's cluster.

A Flutter project of a movies/TV shows app to stay up to date with new releases.

This app shows the lastest and upcoming movies/TV shows using [The Movie Data Base](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.

Since the idea is to have a cluster or ["constellation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antlia) of data, there comes the name.
